      <h1>About me!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Adrian, and I'm driven by a deep passion to become a
        front-end software developer. Currently, I'm on the verge of completing
        a comprehensive bootcamp program offered by Edx. Through this intensive
        learning experience, I've gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, jQuery,
        Bootstrap, Node.js, JavaScript, and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, I can effectively structure
        and style web pages. jQuery has enhanced my ability to manipulate the
        Document Object Model (DOM) and create dynamic, interactive user
        experiences. Bootstrap provides me with a powerful framework for
        building responsive and visually appealing websites with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript, as the language of the web, empowers me to add functionality
        and interactivity to my projects. With React's component-based
        architecture, I can build complex user interfaces efficiently. Armed
        with these technologies, I'm well-equipped to tackle a wide range of
        front-end development projects. I'm excited about the opportunities
        ahead and am eager to make a meaningful impact in the world of software
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Github you can see the day by day progress and on LinkedIn all
        certificates that I gained since I started to learn coding.
